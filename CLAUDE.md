# ReviewBot

A self-hosted GitHub App that automatically reviews pull requests using an LLM (Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, or local via Ollama/LM Studio/vLLM).

## Build & conventions

```
dotnet build                       # solution-wide
dotnet format                      # apply .editorconfig style
```

- Targets **.NET 10**, `Nullable` and `ImplicitUsings` enabled, **`TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`** — a new warning fails the build. Common settings live in `Directory.Build.props`.
- **Central package management**: all package versions are pinned in `Directory.Packages.props`. Add a `<PackageReference>` without a version in the `.csproj`, and the version in `Directory.Packages.props`.
- File-scoped namespaces and `this.`-qualified fields are the house style (see `.editorconfig`); match the surrounding code.

## Dogfood every change: have ReviewBot review your own PR (REQUIRED)

ReviewBot reviews ReviewBot. After you finish a unit of work, **run it through the bot and read its review before considering the task done** — both to improve the change and to find bugs in ReviewBot itself. This is the project's core feedback loop; treat it as part of "done", not an optional extra.

Tooling lives in `scripts/` and reads `.env.local` (gitignored — GitHub App creds + LLM endpoint, mirroring the Rider "ReviewBot.Api" run config; recreate it from there if missing). The bot is the **reviewbotdemo** GitHub App installed on `JoshuaPeddle/ReviewBot`, so the PR must be on that repo.

The loop:

```bash
# 1. Do the work, commit it, open a PR (branch off main; never commit secrets).
git switch -c my-change && git commit -am "..." && git push -u origin my-change
gh pr create --fill                      # note the PR number, e.g. 21

# 2. Start the bot (background) and wait for health.
scripts/reviewbot-serve.sh > /tmp/reviewbot.log 2>&1 &
until curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:5174/healthz >/dev/null; do sleep 2; done

# 3. Trigger a review (POSTs a locally-signed synthetic webhook for that PR).
scripts/trigger-review.sh <pr-number>    # returns HTTP 202 + a delivery id

# 4. Wait for the worker to post, then read the review back.
tail -f /tmp/reviewbot.log               # watch until the trace is written / review posted
scripts/read-review.sh <pr-number>       # bot's summary + inline comments + trace path
```

How it works: `trigger-review.sh` resolves the PR head SHA via `gh`, builds a `pull_request` `opened` payload, signs it with HMAC-SHA256 using the local webhook secret, and POSTs to `/webhook` — no GitHub webhook tunnel needed. Re-running on the same SHA re-reviews the whole PR (the worker only skips a delta with zero changed files). The per-review trace at `src/ReviewBot.Api/traces/<owner>/<repo>/<pr>-<delivery>.json` has candidate-vs-posted comments, drop reasons, token usage, and the prompt budget — that file, not just the posted comments, is how you judge the bot.

**Always run this loop on every PR you post — it is not optional.** After opening (or pushing to) a PR, invoke ReviewBot on it and read the result before considering the work done.

Then **sort every finding into exactly two buckets** and handle each:

1. **Actionable** — the finding is correct (a real bug, risk, or worthwhile cleanup in *your* change). **Resolve it**: apply the fix in the same effort, then re-review.
2. **Incorrect** — the finding is wrong: a hallucination ("`= ;` is invalid C# syntax" when the source is `= "";`), a comment on a file outside the diff, a claim the build/tests contradict, malformed output, a 400 that fails the whole review. For each one, **do not just dismiss it — reason backward to the flaw in ReviewBot that produced it** (prompt rendering, token budgeting, the model/temperature, comment filtering, the provider adapter) and fix that flaw, with a unit test, as part of the same effort. The incorrect bucket *is* the eval signal; every entry in it is a ReviewBot bug. Example landed this way: `OpenAiContextLimitFitter` refits output tokens and retries when a strict server (vLLM) rejects a request whose prompt + output exceeds the model context window.

Record which findings went in which bucket (and the flaw you traced for the incorrect ones) in the PR discussion so the reasoning is visible.

## Running tests

```
dotnet test                                            # all unit/integration/mocked-e2e tests (fast, no external deps)
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~WebhookEndpoint"   # a single class/test by substring
dotnet test tests/ReviewBot.E2eTests/                  # real-LLM e2e (see below)
```

There are **two** end-to-end test projects — don't confuse them:

- `tests/ReviewBot.E2E.Tests` — full webhook→worker→post pipeline with **WireMock-mocked** GitHub and LLM. Runs as part of the normal `dotnet test`; no external services.
- `tests/ReviewBot.E2eTests` — drives the pipeline through a **real LLM** via Ollama (OpenAI-compatible API). Skips automatically unless configured.

## E2E test (real LLM in the loop)

`tests/ReviewBot.E2eTests/OllamaReviewE2eTests.cs` runs the full pipeline — webhook → worker → real LLM → captured review result.

**Required env vars:**

```
REVIEWBOT_E2E_OLLAMA_MODEL=granite4.1:8b-q4_K_M
REVIEWBOT_E2E_OLLAMA_URL=http://192.168.2.169:11434/v1   # defaults to localhost:11434/v1
```

The test skips automatically if `REVIEWBOT_E2E_OLLAMA_MODEL` is not set or Ollama is unreachable.

**Important:** `OpenAiLlmOptions` is bound eagerly in `AddOpenAiReviewLlm` during `Program.cs` startup, before `WebApplicationFactory`'s `ConfigureAppConfiguration` runs. The test therefore replaces the `OpenAiLlmOptions` singleton directly in `ConfigureTestServices` — do not try to override it via config keys.

## Running live evals against the reference local model

The eval gate for v0.3 is measured against `qwen/qwen3.6-27b` running in LM Studio on the LAN box at `http://192.168.2.167:1234/v1` (or whatever endpoint `.env.eval` configures). Always probe before kicking off a live run — they take ~20+ minutes each.

```
make eval-probe            # fail fast if the LLM endpoint is unreachable
make eval-live-baseline    # retrieval OFF; writes runs/eval-{ts}-baseline.json
make eval-live-retrieval   # retrieval ON;  writes runs/eval-{ts}-retrieval.json
make eval-live-compare     # both + comparison; writes runs/eval-{ts}-comparison.json
```

Outputs land in `runs/eval-{UTC-timestamp}-{label}.json` (gitignored). `EVAL_RUN_LABEL=foo make eval-live-compare` overrides the timestamp if you want a named output.

Config lives in `.env.eval` (gitignored, see `.env.eval.example`). It sets `REVIEWBOT_EVAL_BASE_URL`, `REVIEWBOT_EVAL_MODEL_NAME`, `REVIEWBOT_EVAL_OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `REVIEWBOT_EVAL_CONTEXT_TOKENS`. The Makefile sources it via `-include` and re-exports the variables, so the eval CLI picks up the API key from the env.

If you only need a smoke check that doesn't hit the LLM, `make eval-quick` scores against the committed canned results. The eval CLI itself lives in `tests/ReviewBot.Evals` (verbs: `run-live`, `score`, `compare`); fixtures are in `tests/ReviewBot.Evals/Fixtures`.

> Fixture authoring gotcha: a fixture's name and description leak into the model prompt — keep them neutral so they don't tip off the model. See the eval-fixture-design notes if available.

## Configuration & DI

- All host config is read from environment variables with the **`REVIEWBOT__`** prefix (e.g. `REVIEWBOT__GitHubApp__AppId`, `REVIEWBOT__Anthropic__ApiKey`, `REVIEWBOT__OpenAi__BaseUrl`). Wired in `src/ReviewBot.Api/Program.cs`.
- **Both** LLM providers (`AddAnthropicReviewLlm` and `AddOpenAiReviewLlm`) are always registered at startup; the actual provider for a given PR is chosen per-review from the **per-repo `.github/review-bot.yml`** in the target repository (`IReviewLlmFactory.Create(config.Model)`). Almost every behavior — provider/model, grounding tiers, retrieval, chunking, ignore globs, token budgets — is driven by that YAML (`ReviewConfig`), not by host config.

## Architecture

- `src/ReviewBot.Api` — ASP.NET Core host, webhook endpoint, background worker, tracing, cost
- `src/ReviewBot.Core` — domain types, prompting, LLM interfaces, prompt budgeting & chunk planning, job queue
- `src/ReviewBot.GitHub` — GitHub API (auth, PR fetching, review posting, repo config)
- `src/ReviewBot.Grounding` — language detection, build/test runners, workspace cloning
- `src/ReviewBot.Llm.Anthropic` — Anthropic SDK LLM provider
- `src/ReviewBot.Llm.OpenAi` — OpenAI-compatible LLM provider (also used for Ollama)
- `src/ReviewBot.Persistence` — SQLite via EF Core (idempotency, incremental review state)
- `src/ReviewBot.Retrieval` — SQLite symbol index, C# parser, retrieval provider

### The review pipeline

The spine of the whole system is **`ReviewWorker.ProcessAsync`** in `src/ReviewBot.Api/Workers/ReviewWorker.cs`. The webhook endpoint only validates the HMAC signature, dedups by delivery id, filters events, and enqueues a `ReviewJob` onto a `Channel`-backed queue; `ReviewWorker` (a `BackgroundService` with a bounded concurrency semaphore) does all the real work, end to end:

1. **Resolve token & metadata** — installation token, then PR metadata + per-repo config (concurrently when the head SHA is already known; comment-triggered jobs have no SHA and resolve it first).
2. **Incremental / delta reviews** — `IPrReviewStateStore` records the last-reviewed SHA per PR. On a re-review it compares against the new head and, when possible, restricts the file set (and retrieval indexing) to changed paths only. No changes → skip.
3. **Grounding** (`IGroundingProvider`) — optional, config-gated: language detect → build → tests.
4. **Prompt budget** (`PromptBudget` / `IReviewPromptTokenEstimator` / `IModelContextRegistry`) — the central context-assembly mechanism. The model's context window is divided into system/grounding/response-reserve, and every subsequent stage (retrieval snippets, full-file context, diff) *consumes* from the remaining budget; sections that don't fit are dropped and logged. Read this before changing what goes into a prompt.
5. **Retrieval** (`IRetrievalProvider`) — config-gated. Ensures the repo is indexed at the head SHA (clones into a workspace, full or incremental index keyed by `RepoIndexKey(owner, repo, sha)`), then injects symbol definitions + top callers referenced by the diff.
6. **Chunk planning** (`ReviewChunkPlanner`) — if the diff exceeds the remaining budget, split into directory-aware chunks reviewed in parallel (if the provider `SupportsParallelRequests`) or sequentially, then `ReviewResultMerger` dedups and rolls up severity.
7. **Self-critique & agentic context** — for the single-chunk path, a *speculative* self-critique runs in parallel with agentic context fetching; whichever path wins, the loser is cancelled. Self-critique can drop low-confidence comments.
8. **Post & record** — filter/cap comments per output config, choose the review event, post via `IReviewPoster`, write a per-review JSON trace (`IReviewTraceWriter`) + OTel spans + estimated cost, and persist the new head SHA for the next incremental review.

Failures in any optional stage (grounding, retrieval, full-file fetch) are caught and logged; the review continues with whatever context it has rather than failing the job.
